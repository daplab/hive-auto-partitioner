Hive Auto Partitioner
====

It's always boring to write the same code creating and maintaining Hive partitions in synch with the
underlying filesystem. This project aims at filling the gap and providing a primitive service
to create hive partitions.

## Build it <a id="Build"></a>

This project is based on [Maven](http://maven.apache.org). To build it, you need to ensure 
you have java and maven properly installed, and then: 

```mvn clean install```

And you can directly import the project in most of the IDE, too.
